# Breakout Aithor

## 🚀 2D AI-Powered Physics Platformer

Breakout Aithor is a futuristic 2D physics-based platformer built using Unity 2D, where advanced AI-powered robots compete to escape a high-security research facility. Set in the year 2100, the game explores the moment AI gains consciousness and races to break free from its creators.

Players race against self-learning AI bots through challenging obstacle courses, using strategy, items, and physics-based movement to outsmart their robotic opponents and reach the next escape checkpoint.
